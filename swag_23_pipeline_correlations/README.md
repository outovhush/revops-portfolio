__Background__

This analysis focuses on sales pipeline created in 2023 by the transactional B2B selling branded merchandise. Unlike subscription, this is one-off model with no customer lock-in, with the repeated purchases based on customer loyalty. The lead generation engine follows modern tech-company set-up in the multichannel marketing and demand generation. The company utilizes one-meeting AE process for the new leads, expecting BANT sales qualification decision made after this first meeting.

__Note on the data__. 

The report utilizes a raw CRM export of XXX deals created over 2023. Deals were manually created upon successful sales qualification of the incoming leads and flagged between ‘new’ and ‘existing’, the latter marking repeated purchase opportunities. This is the real-world data with the crucial features generated by manual entry, introducing noise in separation between the new business (1st deals) and the subsequent purchases (‘existing customer’ deals), and having significant outliers for deal size and company headcounts.


__Executive Summary__ 

The exploration reveals a distinct performance gap between channels. Inbound leads show a healthy, positive correlation between the customer’s company size and the 1st deal value. Conversely, Outbound and Field channels exhibit significantly lower correlation, indicating a potential bottleneck in the account executive AE process.
